# Manual

## Running the Program
Load the program file, main.asm, into an IDE that is able to run MIPS ,e.g., MARS. Build and run the program through desired IDE.

## Playing the game
To start, secretly choose a number 1-63 inclusive. The program will display 6 cards, one at a time, each with certain numbers. Determine whether your chosen number appears in the current card displayed and enter 'y' if yes and 'n' if no. The program will include input validation if you enter anything other than those 2 options. After all 6 cards has been displayed, the program will "guess" your number based on your 6 inputs and will be displayed. The program is never wrong :)

## Ending the game
Once the game has finished, it will ask if you would like to play again. Enter 'y' if yes and any other input if no.
